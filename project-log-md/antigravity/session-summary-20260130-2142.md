Agent: Antigravity

## 🎯 Main Objectives
- Design and implement the **Project Continuity System** to allow all agents to track project status.
- Create a central `PROJECT_STATUS.md` dashboard.
- Establish the `project_status_standard` skill.

## ✅ Completed Tasks
- **Analyzed** existing `.agents` structure and identified the need for a high-level status tracker.
- **Created** `D:\genAI\jsk-app\.agents\skills\project_status_standard\SKILL.md`: Defined standards for project status updates.
- **Created** `D:\genAI\jsk-app\.agents\PROJECT_STATUS.md`: The central source of truth with Thai summary, Mermaid roadmap, and active milestones.
- **Updated** `D:\genAI\jsk-app\.agents\workflows\agent-handover.md`: Added mandatory step to update project status before handover.
- **Updated** `D:\genAI\jsk-app\.agents\INDEX.md`: Registered the new skill and file.
- **Verified** the system implementation.

## ⚡ Technical State & Decisions
- **New Standard**: `PROJECT_STATUS.md` is now the single source of truth for high-level project context.
- **Workflow Update**: All agents MUST update `PROJECT_STATUS.md` before ending a session.
- **Integration**: The user/Claude Code has already started using the new file, adding links to new PRPs.

## ⏳ Next Steps / Handover
- **Immediate**: Follow the plan in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`.
- **Next Task**: Execute the tasks linked in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`, specifically the "Unified Handoff/Pickup Skills" or "Rich Menu Persistence" as per the updated roadmap.
- **Reference**: Check `.claude/PRPs/plans/project-continuity-rich-menu-chat-ui.plan.md` (as referenced in `PROJECT_STATUS.md`) for detailed implementation steps for the next phase.
